# Mod 5 Solo Capstone Project: 

Take Care is a self-care/journaling app allows the user to sign up/log in, peruse a list of self-care activities, save, update and delete journal entries pertaining to those activities as well as create original activities. Also uses an external API to view daily affirmations.

App also allows for full CRUD functionality of user’s profile along with encrypted password using BCrypt on the backend and localStorage on the frontend.

* Utilizes localStorage to store encrypted user information client-side
* Implemented Redux to manage state
* Handled serializers on Rails back end to access/manage nested data (including optional belongs_to relationship)
* Used vanilla CSS for all styling including overlays, modals, etc. 

A HUGE thanks to all of my instructors and coaches at Flatiron for their instruction & support. Also great big shout out to hubby Chris for all the dog walks, coffee, general food/water intake. <3

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
